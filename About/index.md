## Hi, I'm Mike.

Most people call me a "user experience designer," but if you asked me I'd go with "software craftsman." My strength is in interaction design, but I like to be involved with every part of the process: user research, visual design and software engineering too. I'm probably not the best person to design a marketing site (although [I can](http://www.foogenda.com) in a pinch), but app UI and data visualization are right in my wheelhouse.

My wife Esther and I own a condo in lovely [Uptown, Chicago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown,_Chicago) -- one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the country. We love the city; we met here as friends, dated here, got [married](http://www.mikeandesther.com) here (at Revolution Brewing, no less!) and we can't imagine moving away.

I have a lot of hobbies that tend to cycle through the forefront of my attention. It's good because I love to be learning new things, but also challenging because I probably won't end up mastering any of them. Right now, I'm focused on [stocking the bar](https://www.pinterest.com/michaelniebling/bar-wishlist/) and learning about craft cocktails, partner dancing with my wife (we do Latin, ballroom & tango at [Sway](http://www.swaydancechicago.com/) on the west side), cooking, learning Spanish, DJing and running.

Here's a picture! This is Esther and I practicing our wedding dance:
