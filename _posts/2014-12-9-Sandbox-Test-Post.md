Here is a block quote:

> By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest. -Confucius

Here is a block of code with triple backtick:

```javascript
function doSomething (parameter) {

	// this is really important
	return parameter + " something!";
}
```

site.name: {{ site.name }}

site.description: {{ site.description }}

site.avatar: ![alt text]({{ site.avatar }})
