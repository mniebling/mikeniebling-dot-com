One of the many downsides of the 2020 quarantine was that my MTG Commander group lost its steam when playing together wasn't safe.

We tried a bit of Brawl on Arena, but didn't love the smaller card pool or the idea of buying a pile of purely digital cards.
We did have good success playing some other board games remotely with Tabletop Simulator, though, so we tried it out with Magic.

To make it happen, all players will need [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/).
The host will need the a table mod; the best one we've found so far is [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2296042369).

Once you're in a session, import a deck by typing:

```scryfall [url-of-deck]```

You can import decks from a lot of sources but I use [Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/users/thebling).
