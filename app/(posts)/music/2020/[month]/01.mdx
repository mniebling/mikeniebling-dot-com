## Album releases

>
  It turns out that Bohren & der Club of Gore with a drum machine instead of a drummer... doesn't feel all that different. _Patchouli Blue_ is another album full of ultra-noir, low tempo jazz meditations. They're still one of the moodiest bands on the planet, whether in a more traditional jazz form _(Sollen es doch alle wiesen)_ or a textural "post-something" mode _(Total falsch)_.

	title="Long Arm — Silent Opera"

  Long Arm is one of my favorite sample-musicians. His music has a real emotional edge to it but without relying on genre clichés — a
  heavy jazz influence shines through and his sounds are always original and interesting.

	title="Nym — Countermagic"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0ZuBGzJLQMRsL7W7Ihpwg9"
>
  Downtempo electronic with a diverse sample palette and silky production.

<Review
	title="The Professionals — S/T"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/41PfMaFddHOcxxkvbycHga"
>
  It's a Madlib and Oh No collab. A little heavy on the interludes for my taste but Madlib's production is exactly as good as you expect and the lyricism is strong.

	title="Arms and Sleepers — Safe Area Earth"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0j1GhcWSL5HczTzT0A2ECb"
>
  Blips and bloops with a warm, analog feel. It's mostly head-nodding stuff but _Leon_, a delicate ballad with Sofia Insua, is a nice standout.

<Review
	title="Session Victim — Needledrop"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0KynfLw1af32baSTI7UO6z"
>
  A slick, funky record built on top of primarily jazz samples. Although _Needledrop_ has some "deep" tracks that come close to background music territory, there's a lot more going on in its drum funk _(No Sky, Blue Sound)_, or spy-jazz soundtrack _(Jazzbeat 7)_ modes.

## Singles/EPs

<Review
	title="Rodrigo y Gabriela — Mettal"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5vcvEvxMGJmBTnzWVRztyH"
>
  What an absolute shredfest. Three insane covers from R&G (Slayer, Megadeth & Metallica), you must give this a spin if you like their other stuff OR if you like metal.

<Review
	title="Nocturnal Sunshine & RY X — Gravity"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1fyCKJgmxG0Vc88xyzjUqz"
>
  I guess this technically came out in 2019 on Nocturnal Sunshine's album _Full Circle_ (that's Maya Jane Coles' alias for her more experimental music). But I wasn't complaining when this track popped back up in my feed, it's a melancholy, bubbling tune that reminds me a little bit of Burial. Music like this makes me want to walk around the city at midnight with headphones on.

## New to Me

<Review
	title="Dhafer Youssef — Sounds of Mirrors (2018)"
	hot
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6tqATFYmtKV4JEbZMlQytX"
>
  Where has _this_ been all my life (or the last two years of it, anyway)? Dhafer Youssef is an oud player with an adventurous range and on _Sounds of Mirrors_ he explores an Indian fusion with none other than Zakir Hussain. I thought this album was absolutely riveting.

	title="Anouar Brahem — Souvenance (2014)"
	hot
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0MVaGeFdZy81oPZJFzSqKI"
>
  Can you tell I was on an oud tangent this month? It's hard to classify the sound of this record but it is a haunting, thought-provoking, gorgeous listen. Check out the page on [ECM's site](https://www.ecmrecords.com/catalogue/143038752917/souvenance-anouar-brahem) for some fascinating context around the music.

	title="Hannah Epperson — Slowdown (2018)"
	hot
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4sM5tOjmOq0ddsT9mli10V"
>
  Hannah Epperson's music is structured around recording each song twice: once in her poppier "Amelia" personality and once by the more minimalist "Iris". It seemed like a gimmick to me at first, but the songs make sense in both modes and the album was fascinating. The "Amelia" stuff is synth-y and soaring at times but it never becomes too sugary and the "Iris" versions have some killer string arrangements, with both versions revolving around Hannah's quirky and delightful vocals.

	title="DJ Khalab — Black Noise 2084 (2018)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/65Ozky8zPcC4GT42JGFW5t"
>
  A crazy interesting record, putting a mega-futuristic edge onto sounds of the African diaspora. Title track _Black Noise_ with Tenesha the Wordsmith sounds like spoken word dubbed over a Raster-Noton track. Yes: as good as you are imagining.

  Psych rock with sitars! Sign me up, please!

	title="HashFinger — Dandelions (2019)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4kj8QjK3MHT9kXNXAixTFd"
>
  I first heard HashFinger on his 2020 collab with Butta and MC Synergy and then checked out his solo production stuff. This is a brilliant example of instrumental hip-hop, one crackly vinyl banger after another.

	title="The Silk Road Ensemble — Off the Map (2009)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3kEIpSvDlpfTZFK6xavHWH"
>
  Silk Road Ensemble is Yo-Yo Ma's world music collaborative. I enjoyed the record, but was surprised to find that some of the music here was actually quite a challenging listen.

<Review
	title="Kelly Lee Owens — S/T (2017)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0vSuMCVgHEYx0ANSBxJX8t"
>
  An album that falls somewhere between shoegaze, techno and pop. It reminded me of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's _EARS_ but with more of a punk influence maybe?
</Review>

<Review
	title="Dawn of Midi — Dysnomia (2015)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4wCpIX2LVk3lZkh4crNPtJ"
>
  A drums-bass-piano trio that weaves through explorations of repetitive, cinematic figures. Spin it if, like me, you dig GoGo Penguin, Portico Quartet, Cinematic Orchestra, etc.
</Review>

<Review
	title="Trichotomy — The Gentle War (2011)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/70aluZevqpvaGYHIYFkfIG"
>
  A piano trio who play dense, tricky stuff with a sense of humor. Reminds me of The Bad Plus, with maybe slightly less of a free-jazz sensibility.

	title="Chick Corea, Christian McBride & Brian Blade — Trilogy 2 (2018)"
  url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1CBNepTAgIWf8j2m4oifPB"
>
  _Trilogy 2_ shows off not just the technical mastery of these three legends, but also how comfortable they are playing together. It's a double album that deserves to be; there's a wide range of compositions and the improvisation never gets boring. Check out [Glide's article](https://glidemagazine.com/234017/chick-corea-reunites-with-fellow-jazz-greats-christian-mcbride-brian-blade-with-trilogy-2-album-review/) for a more in-depth review.

## Shows

<Review
	title="Blockhead, Arms and Sleepers, il:lo @ Lincoln Hall"
>
  I was equally psyched for all three artists on this bill! Arms and Sleepers and il:lo were both a little more high-energy live than on their records and Blockhead headlined with a great DJ set. I loved hearing some of his classics, but he was weaving them in with newer stuff, some heavy bass, and best of all: a bunch of old-school hip-hop mashups.
