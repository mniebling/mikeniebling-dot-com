## Album releases

{% review "Bohren & der Club of Gore — Patchouli Blue", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/57Jc5ixqmNuGudtV51M5aG"
%}
  It turns out that Bohren & der Club of Gore with a drum machine instead of a drummer... doesn't feel all that different. _Patchouli Blue_ is another album full of ultra-noir, low tempo jazz meditations. They're still one of the moodiest bands on the planet, whether in a more traditional jazz form _(Sollen es doch alle wiesen)_ or a textural "post-something" mode _(Total falsch)_.

{% review "Long Arm — Silent Opera", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/2iA2Y0HOnalI1vUDMVRKqm"
%}
  Long Arm is one of my favorite sample-musicians. His music has a real emotional edge to it but without relying on genre clichés — a
  heavy jazz influence shines through and his sounds are always original and interesting.

{% review "Nym — Countermagic",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0ZuBGzJLQMRsL7W7Ihpwg9"
%}
  Downtempo electronic with a diverse sample palette and silky production.
{% endreview %}

{% review "The Professionals — S/T",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/41PfMaFddHOcxxkvbycHga"
%}
  It's a Madlib and Oh No collab. A little heavy on the interludes for my taste but Madlib's production is exactly as good as you expect and the lyricism is strong.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Arms and Sleepers — Safe Area Earth",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0j1GhcWSL5HczTzT0A2ECb"
%}
  Blips and bloops with a warm, analog feel. It's mostly head-nodding stuff but _Leon_, a delicate ballad with Sofia Insua, is a nice standout.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Jon Kennedy — MMXX",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6jC7plcke5Vy9o2QZZKexN"
%}
  Nothing too earthshattering here, but it’s a pleasant listen with slick production in various "electronica" styles. _Back from the Beyond_ is the standout track for me with its Bond-movie feel.
{% endreview %}


## Singles/EPs

{% review "Rodrigo y Gabriela — Mettal",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5vcvEvxMGJmBTnzWVRztyH"
%}
  What an absolute shredfest. Three insane covers from R&G (Slayer, Megadeth & Metallica), you must give this a spin if you like their other stuff OR if you like metal.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Nocturnal Sunshine & RY X — Gravity",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1fyCKJgmxG0Vc88xyzjUqz"
%}
  I guess this technically came out in 2019 on Nocturnal Sunshine's album _Full Circle_ (that's Maya Jane Coles' alias for her more experimental music). But I wasn't complaining when this track popped back up in my feed, it's a melancholy, bubbling tune that reminds me a little bit of Burial. Music like this makes me want to walk around the city at midnight with headphones on.

## New to Me

{% review "Dhafer Youssef — Sounds of Mirrors (2018)", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6tqATFYmtKV4JEbZMlQytX"
%}
  Where has _this_ been all my life (or the last two years of it, anyway)? Dhafer Youssef is an oud player with an adventurous range and on _Sounds of Mirrors_ he explores an Indian fusion with none other than Zakir Hussain. I thought this album was absolutely riveting.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Anouar Brahem — Souvenance (2014)", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0MVaGeFdZy81oPZJFzSqKI"
%}
  Can you tell I was on an oud tangent this month? It's hard to classify the sound of this record but it is a haunting, thought-provoking, gorgeous listen. Check out the page on [ECM's site](https://www.ecmrecords.com/catalogue/143038752917/souvenance-anouar-brahem) for some fascinating context around the music.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Hannah Epperson — Slowdown (2018)", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4sM5tOjmOq0ddsT9mli10V"
%}
  Hannah Epperson's music is structured around recording each song twice: once in her poppier "Amelia" personality and once by the more minimalist "Iris". It seemed like a gimmick to me at first, but the songs make sense in both modes and the album was fascinating. The "Amelia" stuff is synth-y and soaring at times but it never becomes too sugary and the "Iris" versions have some killer string arrangements, with both versions revolving around Hannah's quirky and delightful vocals.
{% endreview %}

{% review "DJ Khalab — Black Noise 2084 (2018)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/65Ozky8zPcC4GT42JGFW5t"
%}
  A crazy interesting record, putting a mega-futuristic edge onto sounds of the African diaspora. Title track _Black Noise_ with Tenesha the Wordsmith sounds like spoken word dubbed over a Raster-Noton track. Yes: as good as you are imagining.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Kikagaku Moyo — Masana Temples (2018)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5g5l9entA4bTztfpLJd1kS"
%}
  Psych rock with sitars! Sign me up, please!
{% endreview %}

{% review "HashFinger — Dandelions (2019)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4kj8QjK3MHT9kXNXAixTFd"
%}
  I first heard HashFinger on his 2020 collab with Butta and MC Synergy and then checked out his solo production stuff. This is a brilliant example of instrumental hip-hop, one crackly vinyl banger after another.
{% endreview %}

{% review "The Silk Road Ensemble — Off the Map (2009)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3kEIpSvDlpfTZFK6xavHWH"
%}
  Silk Road Ensemble is Yo-Yo Ma's world music collaborative. I enjoyed the record, but was surprised to find that some of the music here was actually quite a challenging listen.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Kelly Lee Owens — S/T (2017)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0vSuMCVgHEYx0ANSBxJX8t"
%}
  An album that falls somewhere between shoegaze, techno and pop. It reminded me of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's _EARS_ but with more of a punk influence maybe?
{% endreview %}

{% review "Dawn of Midi — Dysnomia (2015)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4wCpIX2LVk3lZkh4crNPtJ"
%}
  A drums-bass-piano trio that weaves through explorations of repetitive, cinematic figures. Spin it if, like me, you dig GoGo Penguin, Portico Quartet, Cinematic Orchestra, etc.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Trichotomy — The Gentle War (2011)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/70aluZevqpvaGYHIYFkfIG"
%}
  A piano trio who play dense, tricky stuff with a sense of humor. Reminds me of The Bad Plus, with maybe slightly less of a free-jazz sensibility.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Chick Corea, Christian McBride & Brian Blade — Trilogy 2 (2018)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1CBNepTAgIWf8j2m4oifPB"
%}
  _Trilogy 2_ shows off not just the technical mastery of these three legends, but also how comfortable they are playing together. It's a double album that deserves to be; there's a wide range of compositions and the improvisation never gets boring. Check out [Glide's article](https://glidemagazine.com/234017/chick-corea-reunites-with-fellow-jazz-greats-christian-mcbride-brian-blade-with-trilogy-2-album-review/) for a more in-depth review.

## Shows

{% review "Blockhead, Arms and Sleepers, il:lo @ Lincoln Hall" %}
  I was equally psyched for all three artists on this bill! Arms and Sleepers and il:lo were both a little more high-energy live than on their records and Blockhead headlined with a great DJ set. I loved hearing some of his classics, but he was weaving them in with newer stuff, some heavy bass, and best of all: a bunch of old-school hip-hop mashups.
