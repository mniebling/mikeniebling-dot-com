## New to Me

{% review "John Roberts — Glass Eights (2010)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3qjMRuS9EkF3eow4c0jGSX"
%}
  _Glass Eights_ is a collection of deep and sultry house music, perfect for a late-night walk or an afterhours cooldown. My favorite track is _Ever or Not,_ for its shuffling percussion, enveloping bass and mysterious clicks and chimes.

  A short EP of bare-metal drum funk. Melody comes mostly from warm and prominently positioned basslines that remind me a bit of [Khruangbin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2mVVjNmdjXZZDvhgQWiakk), but this record is really all about the kit.

  What a small world. I queued this record blindly from some list or other and immediately recognized _De cara a la pared_ as one of  the early tracks from one of my favorite DJ sets of all time ([Trentemøller's 2006 Essential Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJNI61MBqmE)). I'd never identified it back in the day but hearing it on this album was instantly transporting.

  I'm glad to have found the record anyway; it's a blend of subtle electronic production, slinky torch songs and Mexican traditional music. The sound ranges from "very folky" to "hear this in the lounge at 2:00 AM" and it's solid at all points on that spectrum.
