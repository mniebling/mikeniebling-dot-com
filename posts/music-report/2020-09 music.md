## New to Me

{% review "John Roberts â€” Glass Eights (2010)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3qjMRuS9EkF3eow4c0jGSX"
%}
  _Glass Eights_ is a collection of deep and sultry house music, perfect for a late-night walk or an afterhours cooldown. My favorite track is _Ever or Not,_ for its shuffling percussion, enveloping bass and mysterious clicks and chimes.
