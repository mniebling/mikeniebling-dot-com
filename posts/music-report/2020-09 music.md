## New to Me

{% review "John Roberts — Glass Eights (2010)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3qjMRuS9EkF3eow4c0jGSX"
%}
  _Glass Eights_ is a collection of deep and sultry house music, perfect for a late-night walk or an afterhours cooldown. My favorite track is _Ever or Not,_ for its shuffling percussion, enveloping bass and mysterious clicks and chimes.

{% review "DRB-ADB — DRB-ADB-001 (2017)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0wcoB5ir4dtFsLQAI8PAKr"
%}
  A short EP of bare-metal drum funk. Melody comes from some clean and prominently positioned basslines that remind me a bit of [Khruangbin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2mVVjNmdjXZZDvhgQWiakk) but this record is really all about the kit.
