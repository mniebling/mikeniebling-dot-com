## New to Me

{% review "Brandt Brauer Frick â€” Mr. Machine (2011)", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/46F5HpNfAuG79KGXsauLkr"
%}
  A jazzy expedition into dense rainforest, machetes sawing through the bass, steadily marching to the driving percussion, following the insistent cadence of piano melodies further and further into the darkness...

  _Mr. Machine_ moves fluidly through all points between "techno arranged for traditional instruments" _(Pretend,_ with Emika) and "funky experimentalism" _(Bop)._ It's a supremely physical listen, an overall A+ record, and it makes me excited to check out the rest of their catalog.
