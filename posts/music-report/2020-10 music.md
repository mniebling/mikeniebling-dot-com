## Singles/EPs

{% review "D Double E, P Money, Frisco, BackRoad Gee & Novelist — Tell Me a Ting (Remix)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0kkgKS0LGCp5dQq65cT639"
%}
  The original _Tell Me a Ting_ with Kano was pretty nice, a fun back-and-forth with lots of riffing on the title line. But this remix is huge, with a sledgehammer beat and nonstop bars from Double and his crew.

## New to Me

{% review "Brandt Brauer Frick — Mr. Machine (2011)", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/46F5HpNfAuG79KGXsauLkr"
%}
  A jazzy expedition into dense rainforest, machetes sawing through the bass, steadily marching to the driving percussion, following the insistent cadence of piano melodies further and further into the darkness...

  _Mr. Machine_ moves fluidly through all points between "techno arranged for traditional instruments" _(Pretend,_ with Emika) and "funky experimentalism" _(Bop)._ It's a supremely physical listen, an overall enthralling record, and it makes me excited to check out the rest of their catalog.

{% review "Kaytranada — Bubba (2019)",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5FQ4sOGqRWUA5wO20AwPcO"
%}
  I like Kaytranada but I missed this record last year. The basic feel is stompy funk, neon lights, smoke, cruising with the top down. Serious A-list of guests, too: Estelle, Tinashe, Charlotte Day Wilson, Pharrell, and more!
