## Album releases

{% review "Dezron Douglas & Brandee Younger — Force Majeure", "hot",
  "spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4HTj0uquJXV3AYoqIkPbHG"
%}
  Maybe 2020 has me just missing the intimacy of an in-person show. But this album, a collection of mostly covers/rearrangements, recorded on a single mic in an apartment in Harlem, hit me in exactly the right spot.

  As a pure piece of jazz, it's a communication between bass & harp — two instruments that aren't often in the forefront, and that's pretty interesting by itself. But it's also a revealing communication between two people, showing off their shared wavelength and sending out a message of universality.

  Damn, do I miss live music.
