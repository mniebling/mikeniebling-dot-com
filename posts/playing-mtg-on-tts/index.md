One of the many downsides of the 2020 quarantine was that my M:TG Commander group lost its steam when playing together wasn't safe.

We tried a bit of Brawl on Arena, but didn't love the smaller card pool or the idea of buying a pile of purely digital cards. We did have good success playing some other board games remotely with Tabletop Simulator, though, so we tried it out with Magic!

To make it happen, all players will need [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/), and the host will need the [Workshop table mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222607479).

Once you're in a session, import a deck by typing:

```scryfall [url-of-deck]```

You can import decks from a lot of sources but I use [M:TG Goldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com). The import is a little touchy; decks from there have to be user decklists (not price lists or archetypes).

Here are some of the lists I've put together. Unless stated otherwise, they are aimed at a $500-ish budget and don't tend to include heavy tutors or infinite combo wincons.
