## Album releases

**Mujuice — Rytm Moskva**

**The Cinematic Orchestra — To Believe (Remixes)**
It's not an essential listen unless you're a TCO completionist (like myself), but there are definitely some good tunes here. My favorites were Dorian Concept's airy interpretation of _Lessons_ and the brooding, intense Fennesz remix of _A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life_.

**Pat Metheny — From This Place**
A lush, theatrical release from Pat Metheny's new quartet. I think it's a pretty ambitious record but the band is up to the task and they have a real energy together. String arrangements and vocals both add breadth, although _The Past in Us_ features a harmonica lead which I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I listened.

**Momocurly — Cosmic Lips**
A funky, loungy, jazzy, catchy record with dreamy vocals and mesmerizing rhythms.

## Singles/EPs

**Alfa Mist — On My Ones**
An EP of dynamic and expressive solo piano compositions from Alfa Mist. Not what I expected after hearing _Antiphon_ and _Structuralism_, but I really liked these songs.

**Rockwell — Isolation Ritual**
I don't know how he does it, but few producers sound quite as... cybernetic? digitized? as Rockwell. Here's four high-energy bangers that sound like they traveled back from the future to assimilate you.

## New to Me

**Alaskan Tapes — Views from Sixteen Stories (2019)**
An apt name; this felt like the perfect music for sitting in an armchair and looking out over a crystalline, frigid tundra.
