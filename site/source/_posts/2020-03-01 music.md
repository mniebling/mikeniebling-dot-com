## Album releases

**Rob Clouth â€” Zero Point** &nbsp; ðŸ”¥_Highly recommended!_
_Zero Point_ reminds me of one of my favorite albums of all time, Amon Tobin's _Supermodified_. Both records have incredible scope and detail in their sound design but still remain extremely musical. Early tracks like _Casimir_ cuddle you with fuzz and delicate piano notes but the back end of the album hits like a sledgehammer. Play this through your best sound system and be transported.

**Mujuice â€” Rytm Moskva** &nbsp; ðŸ”¥_Highly recommended!_
Often I struggle to stay engaged with a full album of four-on-the-floor music, but _Rytm Moskva_ is an exception. Every song is a cocktail of warm fuzz and microchips and the record works just as well in your best headphones as it would on a dancefloor.

**The Cinematic Orchestra â€” To Believe (Remixes)**
It's not an essential listen unless you're a TCO completionist (like myself), but there are definitely some good tunes here. My favorites were Dorian Concept's airy interpretation of _Lessons_ and the brooding, intense Fennesz remix of _A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life_.

**Pat Metheny â€” From This Place**
A lush, theatrical release from Pat Metheny's new quartet. I think it's a pretty ambitious record but the band is up to the task and they have a real energy together. String arrangements and vocals both add breadth, although _The Past in Us_ features a harmonica lead which I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I listened.

**Momocurly â€” Cosmic Lips**
A funky, loungy, jazzy, catchy record with dreamy vocals and mesmerizing rhythms.

## Singles/EPs

**Alfa Mist â€” On My Ones**
An EP of dynamic and expressive solo piano compositions from Alfa Mist. Not what I expected after hearing _Antiphon_ and _Structuralism_, but I really liked these songs.

**Rockwell â€” Isolation Ritual**
I don't know how he does it, but few producers sound quite as... cybernetic? digitized? as Rockwell. Here's four high-energy bangers that sound like they traveled back from the future to assimilate you.

**Natureboy Flako â€” Besito**
An EP of clangy, stuttering dancefloor killers, soaked in bass and garnished with just a touch of Flako's trademark soulful texture. Turn this one up and get your neck workout in.

## New to Me

**Alaskan Tapes â€” Views from Sixteen Stories (2019)**
An apt name; this felt like the perfect music for sitting in an armchair and looking out over a crystalline, frigid tundra.

**Westerman â€” Ark (2018)**
It's like an artificial intelligence was trained on a corpus of Beach Boys songs and then set loose on a big collection of drum machines, synths and guitar pedals. A lovely and unique listen.
