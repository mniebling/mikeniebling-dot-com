## New to Me

**Rōnin Arkestra — Sonkei (2019) / Stranger Searching (2019)**
Mark de Clive-Lowe's collective of Toyko jazz musicians shows off a lush & funky sound on these records. The _Stranger Searching_ single is a scorcher but I also really enjoyed _Onkochisin_ and _The Art of Altercation_ from the _Sonkei_ LP.
