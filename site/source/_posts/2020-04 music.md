## New to Me

**Rōnin Arkestra — Sonkei (2019) / Stranger Searching (2019)**
Mark de Clive-Lowe's collective of Toyko jazz musicians shows off a lush & funky sound on these records. The _Stranger Searching_ single is a scorcher but I also really enjoyed _Onkochisin_ and _The Art of Altercation_ from the _Sonkei_ LP.
Spotify: [Sonkei](https://open.spotify.com/album/4hcREbGmsor4meuYc08I5m?si=rmTAkZHbR1KXDZmlXsUtFQ) / [Stranger Searching](https://open.spotify.com/album/0lQ0Uds7iObcNmZPPs5TGN?si=AOuaKWbOT1m1G-_DBxvhaQ)

**Tenderlonius — The Shakedown (2018)**
Ed Cawthorne has a diverse skillset (he's a multi-instrumentalist, DJ and producer) but what we get on _The Shakedown_ is "simply" an hour of propulsive, flute-forward jazz.

**Toundra - II (2010)**
This is a driving, riffy record that toes the line between post-rock and metal. Give it a spin if you like Russian Circles.

**The Physics House Band – Mercury Fountain (2017)**
Lots of heavy music this month! The Physics House Band blend mathy headbanging with a jazz sensibility, bursts of saxophone and shimmering digital textures.
