## Album releases

{% review "Rob Clouth — Zero Point" hot
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4j527M7kj0BfndMBI9oqAl?si=HxXND2OiQ3GiUflH9GnABA
%}
  _Zero Point_ reminds me of one of my favorite albums of all time, Amon Tobin's _Supermodified_. Both records have incredible scope and detail in their sound design but still remain extremely musical. Early tracks like _Casimir_ cuddle you with static and delicate piano notes but the back end of the album hits like a sledgehammer. Play this through your best sound system and be transported.

{% review "Mujuice — Rytm Moskva" hot
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0gb4U8nPDEEXrIbG6og67C?si=I85EzxjFRSm5kPSPjtCTpg
%}
  I often struggle to stay engaged with a full album of four-on-the-floor music, but _Rytm Moskva_ is an exception. Every song is a cocktail of warm fuzz and microchips and the record works just as well in your headphones as it would on a dancefloor.

{% review "Huntsmen — Mandala of Fear" hot
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6h1mELyn2kn5w2kk3PAIQ8?si=yJTnCvduTfyqBwxjZkKamw
%}
  This was one of my favorite metal records in quite some time. The music is properly heavy in places but the band isn't afraid to take chances; they sing clean, mix up the guitar tone, and even let the rhythm section get a bit funky. Production values are very high, too. Absolute A+ record.
{% endreview %}

{% review "The Cinematic Orchestra — To Believe (Remixes)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1EdoFABv3U8Eu6JTi6LU4k?si=torbsZTMSAeoXvK3JoJHsw
%}
  It's not an essential listen unless you're a TCO completionist (like myself), but there are definitely some good tunes here. My favorites were Dorian Concept's airy interpretation of _Lessons_ and the brooding, intense Fennesz remix of _A Caged Bird/Imitations of Life_.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Pat Metheny — From This Place"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5PfjsKZLI9whAwPSfNgnES?si=F2kAc_9dRauVvsYQwHWVdA
%}
  A lush, theatrical release from Pat Metheny's new quartet. I think it's a pretty ambitious record but the band is up to the task and they have a real energy together. String arrangements and vocals both add breadth, although _The Past in Us_ features a harmonica lead which I couldn't get into, no matter how hard I listened.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Momocurly — Cosmic Lips"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/71DXzWc3FqkzKrQHTsh4j5?si=6KwiN7cwTi-pRFex8vhPlQ
%}
  A funky, loungy, jazzy, catchy record with dreamy vocals and mesmerizing rhythms.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Four Tet — Sixteen Oceans"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5gIa8hTQGPwVeNYjDwrraZ?si=Z6dYm58cQCW6o8hb0PUQhA
%}
  I've really enjoyed the gradual evolution in Four Tet's music from downtempo sample-based stuff to incorporating more digital sounds and straight-ahead dance music. This record is a good showcase for his modern sound; fresh house tracks like _Love Salad_ appear along with more introspective pieces like _Mama Teaches Sanskrit_.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Skalpel — Highlight"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0WYUSsTfP7bCyLuCthlBCF?si=yVA2XLW8Qy2EmDappnvXCA
%}
  Skalpel's crate-digging sound is augmented here by some extra electronic noises. This could be a route to boring "nu-jazz" territory, but luckily _Highlight_ avoids that by keeping the focus on dusty vinyl samples and a smoky lounge aesthetic.
{% endreview %}

{% review "J Balvin — Colores"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/2mX8ktJoWvyidWBU9U8Jis?si=wZDH0l24RDSBCU9fYa09RA
%}
  I don't listen to much pop music but J Balvin's production is just irresistible. The rhythms of salsa & reggaeton rarely diverge, but his sounds are always just a little more interesting, more digital, more funky. _Colores_ is extremely danceable, but honestly, I'll just put it on for the vibes.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Luo — Unspoken"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/4yssWRZcdhnkbrIKbjZMdy?si=9VddZJPPRJusLO_Qb4g4kQ
%}
  A funky and frenetic blend of bass, breaks, and djent riffs from this Brighton 2-piece. You might raise an eyebrow at this description, but this record stands _very_ far out from the sawing monotony of a typical "breakcore" record. It's worth a close listen.
{% endreview %}


## Singles/EPs

{% review "Alfa Mist — On My Ones"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6o73C44oWGeDaCjLvoEKtD?si=ZrYVVUODRFOavYi3kznZzA
%}
  An EP of dynamic and expressive solo piano compositions from Alfa Mist. Not what I expected after hearing _Antiphon_ and _Structuralism_, but I really liked these songs.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Rockwell — Isolation Ritual"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/54LiXvV6VshKMRrtMoH5jR?si=yZNL1a0fS-aRqzd7fUOsDA
%}
  I don't know how he does it, but few producers sound quite as... cybernetic? digitized? as Rockwell. Here's four high-energy bangers that sound like they traveled back from the future to assimilate you.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Natureboy Flako — Besito"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/39Jpj6n5pYH14PNgAsRcuo?si=tDnGf5DMQLy386B5RYeJnA
%}
  An EP of clangy, stuttering dancefloor killers, soaked in bass and garnished with just a touch of Flako's trademark soulful texture. Turn this one up and get your neck workout in.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Emperor — Daft Funk / Convex"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0UoUQ6LjEAVjTqv33QuoBr?si=oCnngjT6RhGAtQ385bGEkQ
%}
  Not too much to say here, it's just two crunchy neurofunk tunes with Emperor's trademark 24th-century production.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Carl Stone - Au Jus / The Jugged Hare"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/7ht21bNX0BwcpFeVtPAsls?si=z739LIG7QO2UglgPGjLyXA
%}
  This is my first exposure to Carl Stone and it was delightful. His micro-sampling approach on these cuts reminds me of replaying Akufen's _My Way_ over and over back in 2002. That was a sweet record and so is this one!
{% endreview %}


## New to Me

{% review "Alaskan Tapes — Views from Sixteen Stories (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/05ECaoh4qEPv4Ph2M1htDX?si=muFwcaxDTPC5JOpcyQrM8g
%}
  An apt name; this felt like the perfect music for sitting in an armchair and looking out over a crystalline, frigid tundra.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Westerman — Ark (2018)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/19RGFb1YYwnbEwYZc42msT?si=fftSi3ZoQkahzCHYx146Kw
%}
  It's like an artificial intelligence was trained on a corpus of Beach Boys songs and then set loose on a big collection of drum machines, synths and guitar pedals. A lovely and unique listen.
{% endreview %}

{% review "Mary Lattimore & Mac McCaughan — New Rain Duets (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/1gmSf3ZNJwzkrCwtK0wzFD?si=0w5S57rPTUaF7x6_jE885A
%}
  A mysterious little record of collaborations between harpist Mary Lattimore and Merge Records boss Mac McCaughan on synthesizers. It's minimalist, but not ambient; there's a lot going on here.
