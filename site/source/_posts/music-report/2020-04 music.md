## New to Me

{% review "Rōnin Arkestra — Sonkei (2019) / Stranger Searching (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0lQ0Uds7iObcNmZPPs5TGN?si=AOuaKWbOT1m1G-_DBxvhaQ
%}
  Mark de Clive-Lowe's collective of Toyko jazz musicians shows off a lush & funky sound on these records. The _Stranger Searching_ single is a scorcher but I also really enjoyed _Onkochisin_ and _The Art of Altercation_ from the _Sonkei_ LP.

{% review "Tenderlonius — The Shakedown (2018)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/7MreUClNVIul1cGQNPipYU?si=7wISmkzmTEKoFpy4_KjUog
%}
  Ed Cawthorne has a diverse skillset (he's a multi-instrumentalist, DJ and producer) but what we get on _The Shakedown_ is "simply" an hour of propulsive, flute-forward jazz.

{% review "Toundra - II (2010)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/54LcH6rOpnX8afrvtGvL1h?si=T2ZqIIEJTRqZWdx5NhQqcg
%}
  This is a driving, riffy record that toes the line between post-rock and metal. Give it a spin if you like Russian Circles.

{% review "The Physics House Band – Mercury Fountain (2017)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3HYb9C7ZODFw74BSsMhNCy?si=qgxuAugmRtumYusK8W7XHg
%}
  Lots of heavy music this month! The Physics House Band blend mathy headbanging with a jazz sensibility, bursts of saxophone and shimmering digital textures.

{% review "Emilio Solla Tango Jazz Orchestra — Puertos (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZX0Q9nZLuwu6LObzLZYMV?si=QNsowrabQIqvFu84dHSvPA

  I was a little skeptical since records like this often lean into the cheesy commercialism of tango music. But this album was a nice surprise; it falls firmly on the jazz side of "tango jazz" and ends up being quite a contemporary listen.
