## New to Me

{% review "Belle Chen — Departure (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/2rOBbnCheGqZvXw4HJYn40?si=nsd96RVKQ0evARcSU_DY-Q

  What an interesting album. You could start out describing this as "solo piano" but it ends up much too distinctive for such a simple label. There are lots of tasty processed piano sounds, a hang drum (I think?), and even a full-out tango.

{% review "Cookin' on 3 Burners — Lab Experiments, Vol. 2 (2018)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/24K46xbN0Gt2mfxEUodxVv?si=Apn_7T_TRSuYImRbFwTnjg
%}
  Nothing too complicated here: this is a scorching funk album. Perfect music for a breezy summer day or a sweaty night on the dancefloor.
