  This Kieran Hebden (Four Tet) pseudonym puts weaker blogs' text encoding to the sword! This EP is a lovely one, made up of three chill, synth-driven tunes; track #1 is a little more ambient, #2 adds some jazzy, shuffling drum samples, and #3 sprinkles a bit of head-nod bass into the recipe.

  A boisterous dance-jazz assault! And yet another very excellent record coming out of the youthful London scene.

  An electronic album with a diverse range of styles. Typically with stuff like this I expect a "jack of all trades, master of none" result, but I was pleasantly surprised here. There's soul, dancehall, Bonobo-style house and Boards of Canada-style blips and bloops and all of it is distinctive and high-quality.

  Not all music needs to be challenging. _Kite_ is a mellow and thoughtful album of compositions rooted in piano, although they at times incorporate electronics and effects. Recommended for a sunny spring day after the rain has stopped and the clouds are parting.

  What an interesting album. You could start out describing this as "solo piano" but it ends up much too distinctive for such a simple label. There are lots of tasty processed piano sounds, a hang drum (I think?), and even a full-out tango.

{% review "Cookin' on 3 Burners — Lab Experiments, Vol. 2 (2018)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/24K46xbN0Gt2mfxEUodxVv?si=Apn_7T_TRSuYImRbFwTnjg

  Nothing too complicated here: this is a scorching funk album. Perfect music for a breezy summer day or a sweaty night on the dancefloor.
