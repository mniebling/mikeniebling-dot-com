## New to Me

{% review "Black Chamber — S/T (2016)" hot

  Now this is right up my alley. It's a very noir, jazz/trip-hop fusion that stays maybe 80% or so on the jazz side; it has just enough extra texture and processing to kick up the haunting factor, but it avoids the fate of your average "downtempo" electronic record by staying focused on real instruments, real improvisation and real emotion.

  "Head-nodding" is inadequate for the weight of the production on this instrumental hip-hop joint. It's heavier, more exotic, more alien.
