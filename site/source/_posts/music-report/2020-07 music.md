## Singles & EPs

{% review "Sebastian Mullaert & Tonhalle Orchester Zürich — Moonwaker"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3DY0wIWDSqtjMle5lyWf8W?si=tGJGuzt-SniCZXNDSHDopg
%}
  A dramatic deep house track with glitchy percussion and moody strings. I love "dance" music that sounds like this!

## New to Me

{% review "Aukai — Branches of Sun (2018)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/21xTZ8iQcD3eOm63lVNAbs?si=U8lOJGDlQXmHNiLQGqK-IA
%}
  A delightful record that melds acoustic and digital sounds together in a broad range of energy levels. At the most chill end: ambient tracks like _Colorado_. In the middle: the textural string-plucking & piano arpeggios on _Fragmentary Blue_. On top: the boisterous post-rock of _Turning Days_.
