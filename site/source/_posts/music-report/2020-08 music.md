{% review "Kaleema — Nómada (2017)" hot
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/68bLitsNKEqRgak8wQL2vE?si=11miQLDcSdGFJBUqDwQrBw
%}
  Hypnotic, seductive, dangerous. I love records that defy a genre label and I think _Nómada_ is a great example of that; it has humid percussion, dreamy strings and a fuzzy echo of South American folk music, all lurking under the electronic pulse of house? downtempo? pop?

{% review "Sophie Hutchings — Yonder (2017)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/7MZZGiPrjcfqhkmsZlWHa4?si=e40Ms_oYRTqhBpbUNKSAqA
%}
  _Yonder_ is like a quiet evening with close friends. It's warm and engaging, and when it's over you're surprised how the time has slid past so smoothly. Sophie Hutchings' piano compositions are simple, but not minimalist, and show off a great sense of feel and timing. It's good relaxation music but has a rewarding depth there for more active listeners.
