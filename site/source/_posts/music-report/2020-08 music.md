## New to Me

{% review "Kaleema — Nómada (2017)" hot
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/68bLitsNKEqRgak8wQL2vE?si=11miQLDcSdGFJBUqDwQrBw
%}
  Hypnotic, seductive, dangerous. I love records that defy a genre label and I think _Nómada_ is a great example of that; it has humid percussion, dreamy strings and a fuzzy echo of South American folk music, all lurking under the electronic pulse of house? downtempo? pop?

  As a bonus, check out the killer playlist Heidi maintains: [El Futuro es Feminino](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1PcY1pUnYhMjYknkTatxs2?si=DCTtGgpWTDGt7j5kjlJxsQ)

{% review "Sophie Hutchings — Yonder (2017)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/7MZZGiPrjcfqhkmsZlWHa4?si=e40Ms_oYRTqhBpbUNKSAqA
%}
  _Yonder_ is like a quiet evening with close friends. It's warm and engaging, and when it's over you're surprised how the time has slid past so smoothly. Sophie Hutchings' piano compositions are simple, but not minimalist, and show off a great sense of feel and timing. It's good relaxation music but has a rewarding depth there for more active listeners.

{% review "Eli Keszler — Empire (2019)"
  spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3xCWhKifoOHkPX0H9VpXxj?si=-nGu4DxuSbmyYsp0y9zEQw
%}
  A fascinating EP from avant-garde percussionist Eli Keszler. Trust me: this one is more accessible than "avant-garde percussionist" makes it sound! I imagine it as the soundtrack for a noir flick set on a space station in the year 2300.
