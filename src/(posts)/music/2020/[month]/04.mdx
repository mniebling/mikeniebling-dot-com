## Album releases

<Review

	This is Elder at their soaring, proggy best. It has the monster riffs & hooks you'd expect, but also feels like the natural evolution of their sound into something just a hair more polished.

	I don't know if I have too much to add to the commentary on this record. I do enjoy it; I think it's a very interesting listen, full of musical ideas, rhythmically quite complex, and lyrically poetic (although maybe a bit angsty for my tastes). I'm definitely glad to have experienced this, but I don't think it will make it into my heavy rotation.

	It's a beat tape, alright. Pretty solid stuff here, sometimes lo-fi, sometimes a bit cinematic, in general a solid record if you're looking for instrumental hip-hop.

## Singles/EPs

<Review
	title="Redi Hasa & Akın Sevgör — Time"
	hot

>
	Oh my. I'm very happy to have stumbled across cellist Redi Hasa via his collaboration with the amazing Akın Sevgör here. This track is a cocoon of sound, gently weaving curls of string, synth and glitch until you feel completely at peace. This sound reminds me quite a bit of Murcof and these guys are quickly joining him in my list of all-time favorites.

	title="Hedrun — Vulnerable in Bihag / Mose Bole Na"
	hot
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/69T5pgjJNvpE54owxAcJey"
>
	This meditative EP feels like a science-fiction bhajan. _Vulnerable in Bihag_ includes the skeleton of a devotional: chiming cymbals, quiet percussion, vocals and the gentle drone of a tanpura, but it's mixed to feel like the ancient memory of a prayer. _Mose Bole Na_ is even more deconstructed, with a slower tempo, an icy fog settling over the vocals, and the suggestion of a drummer's dream, textural and long-forgotten.

	title="Plini — Birds/Surfers"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/6nckP9PhHnhV99ixd4wPJA"
>
	Plini is fully exploring the "prog" part of "prog rock" on this short EP. Two very pretty sketches, full of textures. I was disappointed there's only four minutes of material here.

## New to Me

<Review
	title="Rōnin Arkestra — Sonkei (2019) / Stranger Searching (2019)"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/0lQ0Uds7iObcNmZPPs5TGN"
>
	Mark de Clive-Lowe's collective of Toyko jazz musicians shows off a lush & funky sound on these records. The _Stranger Searching_ single is a scorcher but I also really enjoyed _Onkochisin_ and _The Art of Altercation_ from the _Sonkei_ LP.

	title="Tenderlonius — The Shakedown (2018)"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/7MreUClNVIul1cGQNPipYU"
>
	Ed Cawthorne has a diverse skillset (he's a multi-instrumentalist, DJ and producer) but what we get on _The Shakedown_ is "simply" an hour of propulsive, flute-forward jazz.

	title="Toundra - II (2010)"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/54LcH6rOpnX8afrvtGvL1h"
>
	This is a driving, riffy record that toes the line between post-rock and metal. Give it a spin if you like [Russian Circles](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0AZ3VR0YbFcS0Kgei7L2QF) or [Pelican](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Gq06EJlfPumvCdMsnkJFp).

	title="The Physics House Band – Mercury Fountain (2017)"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/3HYb9C7ZODFw74BSsMhNCy"
>
	Lots of heavy music this month! The Physics House Band blends mathy headbanging with a jazz sensibility, bursts of saxophone and shimmering digital textures.

	title="Emilio Solla Tango Jazz Orchestra — Puertos (2019)"
	url="spotify:https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZX0Q9nZLuwu6LObzLZYMV"
>
	I was a little skeptical since records like this often lean into the cheesy commercialism of tango music. But this album was a nice surprise; it falls firmly on the jazz side of "tango jazz" and ends up being quite a contemporary listen.
